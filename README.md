### About Smile Line

### Helping the World


### What We Learned from the Project
- Learning the server folder structures for incorporating MongoDB/Mongoose in our app. This allows storage of data in the back end with CRUD operations.
- Using GraphQL/Apollo client to organize data through queries and mutations
- Setting up the app so the server as well as the client is running concurrently
- Implementing signup/login and authentication with JWT
- Learning client folder strutures for React.js to build the front end
