### About Smile Line

We want to create an application that will streamline communication between dentists and their patients. Our hope is that it creates an environment of knowledge and safety prior to the appointment! We know many patients do not ask questions of their dentist because they may feel rushed, or feel that they're asking a dumb question, or they get so scared that they forget to ask. We also hope that for both parties, it will help to save time! (Yes, less time in a dental chair is what everyone hopes for!)

### Helping the World

Many people all over the globe do not have access to dental information or knowledge. Many people do not know that there is a proper way to brush and floss. Many people do not know WHY it is important to maintain oral hygiene. As a result of this lack of information, many people live with cavities and pain, which could've been prevented. Arming people with the knowledge to take care of themselves will help to reduce the amount of people in pain, patients in the emergency rooms, employees taking time off work for pain/dental procedures/recovery, and students missing school and activities.

### What We Learned from the Project

- Learning client folder strutures for React.js to build the front end
- Following HIPAA protocol is very difficult and strict

### Future Development

- Implementing proper HIPAA protocols with patient information
- Being able to retrieve dentists' contact information and display it only to their specified patient pool
- Creating a messaging system where patients can send short queries to their dentists
